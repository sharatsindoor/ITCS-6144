For the First Question -->Single-source Shortest Path Algorithm
-->Run the main_dijkstra's.py
-->We have implemented the dijkstra's algorithm for Directed and Undirected Graph seperately.
-->The dijkstra's algorithm for Directed Graph is implemented in the dijkstra.py
-->For the Undirected Graph is implemented in dijkstra_undirected.py 
For the Second Question -->Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm-Prim's Algorithm
-->Run the main_prim's.py
-->And the Algorithm is implemented in prims_algo.py
For the Third Question to find the Strongly connected component of the graph
-->Run the main_kosaraju's.py
-->And the Algorithm is implemented in kosaraju_graph.py 

Filenames for Directed Graph are:
Input1_DGraph.txt
Input2_DGraph.txt
Input3_DGraph.txt
Input4_DGraph.txt

Filenames for Undirected Graph are:
Input1_UDGraph.txt
Input2_UDGraph.txt
Input3_UDGraph.txt
Input4_UDGraph.txt

You just have to replace the filename for getting outputs for different graph's
If there is a list out of bound exception then just the give backspace till the end of the 
line.so that ther will not be a error.

IDE Tested On: VS CODE,PYCHARM.
